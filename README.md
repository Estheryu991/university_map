hello, this is the treasure hunt game for SKKU_SuSeo

so this will make the school places 
1. purpose of the project:  an app that can help international students find interest in places and things to do. 
2. content of the project: 1. using machine learning & deep-learning; if there is a picture recognition. -> by uploading pictures; use it to categorize the pictures; if someone post a picture of the library, and compare with the recognized library.
3. significance of the project: using data, let the user recognize that this place is the library, and recommend friends arounds you. 
4. result of the project(final product):-> accomplish the goal by friends around you. -> an app that recommends the places. -> app to automatically tell you where you are and according to your preferences, tell you what you can do and go. 

problem: just previous experience, 
how can the app know your preferences: 
* using the previous data that the user has left-> the tracebacks
* a system which collects the data 
* a rating system (algorithm) of detection of good and bad (feedback system) 
* rating  
* (kruskal algorithm) 
* Collaborative filtering (CF) and its modifications
* Step 1: Data collection:The first and most important step for creating a recommendation engine is to gather data. There are two main types of data to be collected:
*Implicit Data: This includes information collected from activities such as web search history, clicks, cart events, search log, and order history.
*Explicit Data: This is information gathered from customer input, such as reviews and ratings, likes and dislikes, and product comments.
*Recommendation engines also use customer attribute data such as demographics (age, gender) and psychographics (interests, values) to identify similar customers, as well asfeature data (genre, item type) to identify product similarity.
* Step 2: Data storage: Once the data is gathered, it needs to be stored. Over time, the amount of data will grow to be vast. This means ample, scalable storage must be available. Depending on the type of data you collect, different types of storage are available.
* Step 3: Data analysis: To be used, the data must then be drilled down into and analyzed. There are several different ways in which you can analyze data. These include:
*Real-time analysis: Data is processed as it is created.
*Batch analysis: Data is processed periodically.
*Near-real-time analysis: Data is processed in minutes instead of seconds when you donâ€™t need it immediately.

Step 4: Data filtering

The final step is filtering. Different matrixes or mathematical rules and formulas are applied to the data depending on whether collaborative, content-based, or hybrid model recommendation filtering is being used. The outcome of this filtering is the recommendations.
